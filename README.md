My girlfriend is also a web developer and her and I constantly tease each other about our technical abilities. As of recent she has become a very skilled developer and she began to tease me about the difference in our skillset. I set my mind to close that gap and I developed this weather site. I included various web design disciplines such as API calls and lazy loading amongst others. I have since closed that gap and gained the skills and confidence to match her web design abilities. We continue to push each other to grow our skills.
